  promotional emails or general newsletters.
- A score of 3-5 is for moderately important emails that may have some
  relevance but are not urgent.
- A score of 6-8 should be used for emails that are quite important,
  affecting ongoing projects or tasks significantly.
- A score of 9-10 is reserved for highly urgent and critical emails
